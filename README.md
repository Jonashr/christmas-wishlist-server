# Christmas-wishlist-server

## About
This is a NodeJS coding challenge that can be found at [Glitch Santa App](https://glitch.com/~nodejs-santa-app).
Anyone can attempt this challenge by remixing their own using the link above and following the instructions. 
It is a fun little challenge, so please feel free to remix your own and see how it goes.

It is a quite simple application. However, it did teach me how to use cron jobs programatically. Previously, I've only used cron jobs as part
of running jobs on AWS, so it was nice fun to learn how to run cron jobs programatically. This is likely something I will also use in some of my future projects.

I also made an accompanying [React App](https://github.com/Jonashr/christmas-wishlist-client) for the client part of the challenge just for fun. 
Feel free to check this out as well!
